## Resourcing (use of time)
The total time spent working with the sketch was about 6 days, 6 hours each.

## Technology choices
I used the grid, links to Google libraries, sass and some svg graphics.

## General thoughts about the work process and what was learned
I didn’t copy the site form, but tried to do everything myself from the beginning. Making a sketch was easier than bringing it to life. I didn’t use libraries as Bootstrap because I wanted to practice without them. But in real life, I would use them for speed. The hardest thing was to make responsive page depends of screen width and arrange the parts of the page neatly. I got good practice during the task and feel more confident to create something more complex


## Grade proposal for yourself, with reasoning

- [+ ] Reasonable use of libraries/frameworks 
- [+ ] Have the elements of the library been in development from the beginning, or has the library been slapped on top of a ready-made site and a couple of elements quickly put into use?
I done all by myself except navigation.
- [+ ] Technological challenge
- [ +] Responsive implementation
- [ ] The teacher looks at how the website scales in different browsers
- [ +] Use of CSS preprocessor
- [+] For a grade of four (4) or higher, a CSS preprocessor (SASS or any) should be used
- [ ] Is the use progressive, was there any benefits compared normal CSS?
- [ ] This is not absolutely necessary, you can also use another modern solution for CSS, for example TailwindCSS
- [ ] Visuality
- [ ] Typography
- [ ] Images
- [ ] Animation
- [+ ] SVG graphics
- [ ] Website performance
- [ ] This is affected by e.g. graphic optimization. You can examine e.g.: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/
Speed Index is 2.7 s for mobile version and 3.2 s for desktop version maybe because of larger background image

I think the final grade is between 4 and 5. I am not satisfied about final visuality but I tried to use new knowledges from all lessons in this webpage.
