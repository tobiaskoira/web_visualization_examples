## Resourcing (use of time)
The total time spent working with the sketch was about 6 days, 6 hours each.

## Technology choices
I used the grid, links to Google libraries, sass and some svg graphics.

## General thoughts about the work process and what was learned
I didn’t copy the site form, but tried to do everything myself from the beginning. Making a sketch was easier than bringing it to life. I didn’t use libraries as Bootstrap because I wanted to practice without them. But in real life, I would use them for speed. The hardest thing was to make responsive page depends of screen width and arrange the parts of the page neatly. I got good practice during the task and feel more confident to create something more complex
